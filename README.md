# [Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/mjarau/Churn-Prediction)
* In this project, several Machine Learning algorithms were used and evaluated in order to determine the most suitable ML model for customer churn prediction.
* The best trained model tested in this project is Logistic Regression Classifier Model with 83% accuracy compared to the other tested ML algorithms. Testing with other ML classification models may generate better predictions. Tuning some parameters on the models may potentially result in better predictions
* The dataset used is from telecommunication company, Telco where customer attributes such as customer account and demographic information, services that each customer signed up for, and customer who churned in the previous month. The data can be obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

# [Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection: Project Overview](https://github.com/mjarau/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)
* In this project, several Machine Learning classification models were used and evaluated in order to determine the best-suited ML model for credit card fraud detection. The best trained model tested in this project is Naive Bayes with Naive Bayes 97% accuracy and 96% AUC score compared to the other tested models in this project.
* The dataset has been collected and analyzed during a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. It consists of transactions made by credit cards in September by European cardholders. The data can be obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# [Project 3: Breast Cancer Classification: Project Overview](https://github.com/mjarau/Breast-Cancer-Classification)
* In this project, breast cancer classification was performed using several Machine Learning algorithms. The tested models were then evaluated in order to determine the most suitable ML model that demonstrated the best prediction of whether the cancer was benign or malignant. Amongst all the trained models, XG-Boost classifier algorithm produced the highest AUC ROC and accuracy scores at 99.8% and 98%, respectively.
* The data used in this prediction was obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data. It consists of 33 columns and 569 rows of which 30 predicting features. Features were computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

# [Project 4: Life Expectancy Prediction (WHO): Project Overview](https://github.com/mjarau/Life_Expectancy_Prediction_xgb)
* Life expectancy prediction was performed using an XG-Boost model. The RMSE and R2 score of XG-Boost model are 1.61 and 0.97, respectively.
* The data used in this prediction was obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who 
It was obtained from the year 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. It consists of 22 columns and 2938 rows in which 20 predicting variables included categories i.e., Immunization-related factors, Mortality factors, Economic factors, and Social factors.

# [Project 5: Sentiment Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/mjarau/Sentiment-Analysis/tree/main)
* For this project, four machine learning (ML) models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree) were used to predict sentiment analysis of movie reviews. The best-suited ML model was observed to be SVM classifier model with 84% accuracy compared to the other models. 
* The data used in this prediction was obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews. 
The data is an IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews containing two columns (review and sentiment) that will assist us in identifying the type of a review whether it is positive or negative.
